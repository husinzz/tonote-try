# Hi

- Things that didnt went to plan list \*

* Didnt get to add the input task
* Task is not sticky to the top
* The add button wont go to its place
* Coundt add the trash button in the note card
* Deleting a note wont update the page imidietly

- Everything that did went to plan

* When fetching Task the fetch is only run once
* When deleting a task the api runs only when needed and does not run when the visual is updated
* When deleting a task the visual is rerendred and wont need to fetch from the api again
* Deleting Editing and adding only needs one page
* Navigation is sticky
* Todolist can delete task easyly

# Now the best part

- Evaluations \*

* Think of things patiently and sleep with it, solutions comes with patience
* When fetching data think of it carefully cause when fetching data accidently go while the whole server will crash
* React is cool

- What i learned \*

* How to fetch data beter without brakeing everything
* How to rerender in react without crashing firefox
* How to stratigly use States in react
* How to stratigcly use hooks
* How to use Float, Displays, Positioning
* How to use Rerenders as a weapon not as a crashing tool

# I like to make up words for myself and only for myself so enjoy reading my rambling.
